*Development of the Final Project*


In order to advance my project from its state as a storyboard in part 2 ot a finished product in part 3, I incorporated feedback from users, added missing data, and developed a visual theme for the project in Shorthand. First, I spoke with a few individuals who were familiar with the topic of my project who gave me feedback regarding making my "cellphone use" chart simpler, which was a simple change. I did speak with one individual who was unfamiliar with my topic, who recommended that I use more transitory language and imagery as I move from one sub-topic to another. This was particularly helpful, because in my mind, everything tied together very logically. However, looking at the information from an outsider's perspective, the project jumped from the topic of microphone capabilities, to cellphone ownership, to malware attacks, to my call to action, all with very few cues as to how each topic ties into the next. This also was not a major change to my project, but made a huge difference in its comprehensibility.

I also researched additional information to complete my timeline of advances in audio listening, which I think was a particularly informative graphic for viewers to get a picture of how much information is learned from audio recordings. Additionally, one of the charts that I wanted to reformat (the Verizon chart) just didn't have good enough data to actually recreate, so I ended up utilizing the Malware Downloads chart that I created for a previous assignment. This chart was not ideal for representing the story that I wanted to illustrate, so I decided to focus on the aggregate data it represented rather than trends over time. 

Finally, I spent some time figuring out how to format Shorthand so that the background of my entire presentation was black, to fit with the mood that I wanted to create. To achieve this, I ended up using black screenshots from canva and uploading them as images in Shorthand
